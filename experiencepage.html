              I have been working as a junior full-stack developer at Sitek
              Solutions in Lexington, KY. I mainly work on front-end
              development, where I receive backend data from my coworkers, and I
              construct the user interface so the customers can utilize the
              website. I developed a strong understanding of Angular,
              javascript, and HTML/CSS from this position. I also had some
              opportunities to learn the backend development processes using C#
              and SQL Server Management Studio. I also got familiar with using
              Github and collaborating in a team setting.

              At Eastern Kentucky University, I had a chance to work as a
              teaching assistant for CSC 195. It is an intro class for discrete
              structures, which is a core computer science class for freshmen. I
              led more than 40 students to successfully finish the course. My
              duties include designing labs, grading labs and homework, and
              tutoring students on an individual basis. I was able to
              review/retain my knowledge on this topic throughout this
              experience, and I enhanced my communication skills by constantly
              teaching/tutoring students.

              At Eastern Kentucky University, I also worked as a tutor at
              Computer Science Informational Technology Tutoring Center. I
              offered tutoring for all computer science classes I have taken.
              The classes that I tutored most commonly were Java programming and
              database classes. This was a very rewarding job as I was getting
              lots of positive feedback from students that their grades have
              gone up dramatically after coming to my tutoring.

              Working at the Student Success Center at Eastern Kentucky
              University was such a valuable experience. I acquired so many
              priceless skills through this job. My duties included providing
              tutoring for not only computer science, but also all classes that
              I have taken. I was also assigned some students who were not doing
              well, and I provided them with weekly mentoring throughout a
              semester; I have brought up my mentee's GPA and overall
              performance by a significant amount. I also led a workshop not
              only for students but also for my coworkers. Each workshop had
              about 5-20 attendees. On top of that, I was responsible for
              logging/changing/reporting my coworkers' shift coverage and course
              coverage using Excel. This job gave me good leadership skills,
              communication skills, and Excel skills.

              updating and retrieving requested information for the alumni.
              Sometimes I would go to the event scene and assist in setting up

              The first on-campus job I had at Eastern Kentucky University is
              EKU IT Geek. This is the place I learned customer service skills,
              communication skills, and the ability to work in a team setting. I
              had quite a few duties for this job, and I acquired a lot of good
              skills from the duties. For example, my duties included renting
              electronic devices, software troubleshooting, networking
              troubleshooting, hardware troubleshooting, and taking professional
              portrait pictures. I learned so many different hardwar&software
              skills from this experience, but the most important thing I
              learned from this position is being responsible for the job I have
              and being professional as it was my first job ever.
